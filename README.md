OMG just stumbled out of Kimge kereksin. I'm still kind of... wow, you know? The theater was chaos, like, full-on circus vibe—popcorn everywhere, crunch crunch underfoot, and that weird dude in the corner who wouldn't stop coughing. My back hurts from sitting so long, ugh, but worth it? I think?

So okay, the movie. Man, the colors! It was like diving into a bag of Skittles with no, uh, water wings. This one scene, where the main guy was just gazing at the sky, felt like looking into a kaleidoscope. Honestly, for a hot sec there, I thought I was in Narnia or maybe the inside of a lava lamp. Is it strange to say it reminded me of my aunt's overly floral living room? Just so much going on.

> There's this emotional bit where the girl (forgot her name, oops) loses something important, like her keys or maybe her soul? Not clear. But the music, man. I swear it was pulling at my heartstrings like a cat tangled in yarn. So dramatic, almost made me wanna download the movie and replay that part until I get it.

Halfway through, there was this random scene with a goat, and I was like what?? but then forgot about it 'cause my brain was melting from the plot twists. Like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while someone narrates your life story.

Was gonna watch the movie again, but dude, who has the time? Remember Tom from work? He asked for a copy ages ago. Sorry, Tom! Worth it, tho! 

At the end, I guess the message was something about coming home to a place that never changes, or was it that everything changes, and that's okay? Honestly, I think my brain was more of a scrambled egg than usual by then.

Ugh, it’s getting chilly out here. Hoodie weather again. I should remember to bring one next time.

    return OOPS!!;
